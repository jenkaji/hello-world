Hi there my name is Jen and I've been working in IT for over 7 years now. My first programming language was Java when I was in college. Since then I have learned javascript, asp.net, c#, pl/sql, esql, etc. I look forward to learning the newer languages that are out there such as Angular, React, Python, etc.
